### Preface

We live in an amazing time. The internet has completely revolutionized the way we go about learning something new. If you want to learn how to change the oil on your car, someone probably already made a video and posted it up on youtube.

For simple tasks, it has never been easier to learn. A quick google search will give you the answer you need most of the time.

However, when it comes to complex, multi-faceted subjects, such as programming, the story is not so simple.

Yes, there are countless tutorials, videos, guides, demos, etc on the internet. __Finding the resources is <u>easy</u>, but organizing and making sense of it all is <u>hard</u>.__

What we need is an approach to organize the information and structure our learning. In otherwords, we must __learn how to learn__. Some call this __<u>meta-learning</u>__.

I'm constantly thinking and refining my approach. In my opinion, meta-learning is the most important skill to develop in our careers.



## The Approach

1. What is it and why learn it
2. Learn the rules
3. Lose your first 100 games
4. Find resources/mentors to help further understanding
5. Find a community
6. Teach sub-topics to someone else in plain english  




### Elixir

For the past few months, I have learning the [elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) programming language. Much has been written about Elixir, so I won't go into too much details about the language itself.

Instead, I want to share my approach of learning elixir, and how to apply this approach to anything else.

#### Lose Your First 100 Games of Go as Quickly as Possible


If you've ever tried to learn the game go, it's likely that you've heard this advice. Instead of digging deep into strategies and tactics, the goal of this first phase is simply to get familiar with how to keep score, get used to looking at the shapes that come up, and familiarize yourself with the rules. Winning and Losing simply doesn't matter.  

After you play enough games, learning strategies and tactics will make a lot more sense, and you can shift your focus to how to win.  

By doing it this way, you will get better faster getting the most out of learning the strategies and tactics.  

This advice can be applied to learning how to program or learning a new programming language as well.  
Learn enough to play the first game -> play a lot of games ->

#### 0. Why learn ____? (A few hours)

Before I decide on learning a language, I must answer the "why" question. What is it about Elixir that gets me excited?

Resources: ELI5

#### 1. Learning the rules (A couple days)

Before you can play your first game, you have to know enough rules to play. When learning a new programming language, this is learning the basics and the syntax.  

This achieved by reading the official documentation,

The goal of this stage is to knowing enough to play you first game.

motivation

Discouraged at this stage. Don't spend too long here.

Resources: Official Documentation, Tutorials, Videos

#### Losing at Elixir

The goal here is not to write good software. It's to write software and try to use the tools.


motivation, patience, dont worry about code quality (you can always come back to this)

The idea is to try out all the rules(use the tools) you've learned in step 1.
Exercism, writing your own code,

#### Get to know the community

Who is playing this game/using this language? What resources are there?




Like most people, I went through the basic documentation on the website, watched some youtube videos, went through some online tutorials, and started going through the most popular books. This gave me a nice overview of the different concepts in Elixir and the functional programming paradigm.

<!--  Image with nodes, time form the connective tissues.-->

Although this is a good start, this only makes me someone know __knows about__ elixir, not someone who __knows__ elixir. I have a lot of nodes of knowledge. Now it's time to solidify how these concepts are related by building my own project.

It's time to start relating what I've learned with what I know. This process is called __Holistic Learning__.

<!--  Image with nodes, time form the connective tissues.-->

What is this like? What is it not like? How do you connect the ideas with ideas you already know?

At this point, I'm starting to get pretty comfortable with the basics language. The next logical step was to build something on my own.

Lose your first 100 games

### Epilogue

Author Daniel Pink suggests in his book [Drive](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805) that people are motivated is autonomy, mastery, and a sense of purpose.

Applying this approach to learning has given me a great sense of satisfaction and motivation. Learning is one of my favorite activities. __In short, learn is fun__.

__Autonomy__: No one is telling me what to learn. I learn new topics because I'm curious about it or want to be able to do something I haven't been able to do before.

__Mastery__: Although I'm not mastering any specific skill when I'm learning something new, I am developing a mastery on meta-learning.  

__Sense of Purpose__: By developing, refining, and communicating what I've learned about meta-learning, I hope to help others become better learners. I think people are far more capable than they realize. I want to help get you to the next level.
