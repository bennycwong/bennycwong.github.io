### Preface

The internet has completely revolutionized the way learn. If you want to learn how to change the oil on your car, someone probably already made a video and posted it up on youtube.

For simple tasks, learn has never been easier. A quick 5-minute google search will give you the answer you need most of the time.

However, when it comes to complex, multi-faceted subjects, such as programming, the story is not so simple.

Yes, there are countless tutorials, videos, guides, demos, etc on the internet. __Finding the resources is <u>easy</u>, but organizing and making sense of it all is <u>hard</u>.__

What we need is an approach to organize the information and structure our learning. In otherwords, we must __learn how to learn__. Some call this __<u>meta-learning</u>__.

I'm constantly thinking and refining my approach. In my opinion, meta-learning is the most important skill to develop in our careers.

### Elixir

For the past few months, I have learning the [elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) programming language. Much has been written about Elixir, so I won't go into too much details about the language itself.

Instead, I want to share my approach of learning elixir, and how to apply this approach to anything else.

But first, an analogy...

#### Lose Your First 100 Games as Quickly as Possible
<!--
Derek and Max, friends since childhood, both want to learn how to play the game of Go. Since they live a couple towns away, they can only see each other 1 month from today. They decide that when see each other, they will play the game. Since both Derek and Max are competitive, they want to win.

Derek, a young man, confident in his intelligence, decides to go to the book store and pick up a book on strategies and tactics. In his free time, he reads and studies the game according to this book.

Max, however, is much more humble in his approach. He goes to a wise master of Go, and asked for some advice on learning the game of Go.

"Lose your first 100 games as quickly as possible.", said the wise sage, and then disappeared into the night, because that's what sages do.

Max went away not sure of what he meant, but had faith that the sage knew what he was talking about.

During the evening, Derek starts to read his book. It's hard work. He doesn't really know what the author means when he mentions x and y terms. It takes time to read, and it's really not all that fun. He reads a chapter a night. He plays a game or two a night, trying to apply the strategies he read about, but they never really came up.

Max, however, starts playing go online with the computer. He doesn't care if he wins or loses, he just plays. Since Max doesn't know any strategies, he lose every game.

After 3 week, Max has played 100 games. He lost every single one of them, although he started to get better towards the end. With a week left before he plays Derek, Max decides to pick up a book on Go. It happens to be the same one that Derek picked up. Max reads it during his lunch breaks at work and continues to play at night.

When Saturday came, Derek and Max finally meet.

Derek, at this point, have been reading the strategies and tactics for a month. Max has only been reading and learning how to win for a week.  

Despite the much shorter time spent on reading strategies and tactics, Max easily beats Derek. Max is the far stronger player.

While Derek jumped right in trying to figure out how to win, Max took some time getting familiar with the landscape.  

By doing so, Max gained an intuitive understanding of the game because he saw a lot of scenarios. He was able to put the strategies he read about into context, making that phase of learning much power impactful.

If you've ever tried to learn the game go, it's likely that you've heard this advice. Instead of digging deep into strategies and tactics, the goal of this first phase is simply to get familiar with how to keep score, get used to looking at the shapes that come up, and familiarize yourself with the rules. Winning and Losing simply doesn't matter.  

After you play enough games, you can shift your attention to learning strategies and tactics. This is where you learn how to win. This is where you want to spend your time and effort. In a sense, you never get out of this phase.  

Learning strategies and tactics is __hard work__. If you skip the first phase, learning how to get better would be mixed in with learning how to play the game. This makes the hard work phase frustrating and discouraging. There are terms and phrases you don't understand. It takes a lot of brain power just to understand the context of the strategy or tactics.

When faced with __hard work__, if we don't have sufficient drive, we often just throw our hands up in the air just give up. If we mix in hard work with the

The goal of losing the first 100 games to develop and intuition for the basics of the game. If you know what it means to win, what an advantage looks like, how to read shapes, learning the strategies and tactics becomes fun!

This advice can be applied to learning how to program or learning a new programming language as well.

### General Approach, Visualized  

Learn enough to play the first game -> play a lot of games ->


<!--
## The Approach

1. What is it and why learn it
2. Learn the rules
3. Lose your first 100 games
4. Find resources/mentors to help further understanding
5. Find a community
6. Teach sub-topics to someone else in plain english  / give a talk

#### 0. Why learn Elixir? (A few hours)

Before I decide on learning a language, I must answer the "why" question. What is it about Elixir that gets me excited?

Resources: ELI5

### Applied to Elixir

#### 1. Learning the rules (A couple days)

Before you can play your first game, you have to know enough rules to play. When learning a new programming language, this is learning the basics and the syntax.  

This achieved by reading the official documentation,

The goal of this stage is to knowing enough to play you first game.

Explore basics. Common terms.


motivation

Discouraged at this stage. Don't spend too long here.

Resources: Official Documentation, Tutorials, Videos

#### 2. Losing at Elixir

The goal here is not to write good software. It's to write software and try to use the tools.


motivation, patience, dont worry about code quality (you can always come back to this)

The idea is to try out all the rules(use the tools) you've learned in step 1.
Exercism, writing your own code,

#### Get to know the community

Who is playing this game/using this language? What resources are there?




Like most people, I went through the basic documentation on the website, watched some youtube videos, went through some online tutorials, and started going through the most popular books. This gave me a nice overview of the different concepts in Elixir and the functional programming paradigm.

<!--  Image with nodes, time form the connective tissues.-->

Although this is a good start, this only makes me someone know __knows about__ elixir, not someone who __knows__ elixir. I have a lot of nodes of knowledge. Now it's time to solidify how these concepts are related by building my own project.

It's time to start relating what I've learned with what I know. This process is called __Holistic Learning__.

<!--  Image with nodes, time form the connective tissues.-->

What is this like? What is it not like? How do you connect the ideas with ideas you already know?

At this point, I'm starting to get pretty comfortable with the basics language. The next logical step was to build something on my own.

Lose your first 100 games

### Epilogue

Author Daniel Pink suggests in his book [Drive](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805) that people are motivated is autonomy, mastery, and a sense of purpose.

Applying this approach to learning has given me a great sense of satisfaction and motivation. Learning is one of my favorite activities. __In short, learn is fun__.

__Autonomy__: No one is telling me what to learn. I learn new topics because I'm curious about it or want to be able to do something I haven't been able to do before.

__Mastery__: Although I'm not mastering any specific skill when I'm learning something new, I am developing a mastery on meta-learning.  

__Purpose__: By developing, refining, and communicating what I've learned about meta-learning, I hope to help others become better learners. I think people are far more capable than they realize. I want to help get you to the next level.
