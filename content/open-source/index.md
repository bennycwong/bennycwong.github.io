### The Riddler Simulations
Practicing Elixir by writing simulations to puzzles by [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/)

#### Elevator Button Riddle
[Click here to see the Elevator Button riddle on Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-solve-this-elevator-button-puzzle/)  

> In a building’s lobby, some number (N) of people get on an elevator that goes to some number (M) of floors. There may be more people than floors, or more floors than people. Each person is equally likely to choose any floor, independently of one another. When a floor button is pushed, it will light up.

#### The Grizzly Problem
[Click here to see the Grizzly Problem on Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-the-grizzly-bear-eat-the-salmon/)  

> A grizzly bear stands in the shallows of a river during salmon spawning season. Precisely once every hour, a fish swims within its reach. The bear can either catch the fish and eat it, or let it swim past to safety. This grizzly is, as many grizzlies are, persnickety. It’ll only eat fish that are at least as big as every fish it ate before.

> Each fish weighs some amount, randomly and uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 kilogram. (Each fish’s weight is independent of the others, and the skilled bear can tell how much each weighs just by looking at it.) The bear wants to maximize its intake of salmon, as measured in kilograms. Suppose the bear’s fishing expedition is two hours long. Under what circumstances should it eat the first fish within its reach? What if the expedition is three hours long?
