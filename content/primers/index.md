## "The best way to learn is to teach it to someone else."
</center>

***

Inspired by The Feynman Technique as taught by [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/) and the ADEPT Method as taught by Kalid Azad at [Better Explained](https://betterexplained.com/), my goal is to become a better student by writing primers (beginner's guides) to others who are also learning. It's also an avenue for me to practice teaching in simple terms. I hope you find these helpful.

Below are my primers.
