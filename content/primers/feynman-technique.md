Inspired by The Feynman Technique as taught by [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/) and the ADEPT Method as taught by Kalid at [Better Explained](https://betterexplained.com/), my goal is to become a better student by writing primers (beginner's guides) to others who are also learning. I hope you find these helpful.

##### Step 1
 Write the name of the concept at the top of a blank piece of paper.

##### Step 2:
Write down an explanation of the concept on the page. Use plain English. Pretend you are teaching it to someone else (e.g a new student). This should highlight what you understand, but more importantly pinpoint what you don't quite know.

##### Step 3

Review what you have pinpointed you don't know. Go back to the source material, re-read, and re-learn it. Repeat Step 2.

##### Step 4

If you are using overly wordy or confusing language (or simply paraphrasing the source material) try again so you filter the content. Simplify your language, and where possible use simple analogy.

##### Conclusion
That's it. A simple and powerful technique to ensure you can rapidly learn and retain new concepts and information.
